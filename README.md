# Speak to Order

A speech recognition app for your next meal.

This app was developed for the Zero To Mastery 3rd coding challenge: https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/Coding_Challenge-3.

It's just a brief proof of concept of an application using the IBM Watson Speech To Text speech recognition service.
